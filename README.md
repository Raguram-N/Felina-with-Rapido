# 🚕 Felina × Rapido  
## Voice-First Elder Mobility Partnership — Pitch Summary

### ✨ One-line Summary
Felina enables senior citizens (60+) to book Rapido rides through simple voice calls — 
unlocking a large, currently unreachable customer segment without requiring app usage or UI changes.

---

## 🎯 The Problem (Rapido Context)

India has 140M+ elders, many of whom:
- Do not use smartphones confidently
- Struggle with apps, OTPs, and touch interfaces
- Depend on family or neighbors for short-distance travel

**Result today:**
- Elders avoid mobility unless assisted  
- Rapido loses a high-frequency, low-competition user group  
- Families shoulder unnecessary dependency burden  

> Digital adoption ≠ Digital accessibility.

## 💡 The Solution — Felina as a Voice Layer

Felina acts as a consent-first voice interface between elders and Rapido.

**How it works:**
1. Elder places a phone call to Felina  
2. Felina confirms intent + consent  
3. Felina books a Rapido ride  
4. Confirmation via voice + optional family notification  
5. SOS escalation if required  

✨ *Elder never touches an app. Rapido gains a new rider.*
