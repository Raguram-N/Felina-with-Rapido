# 🤖 Felina - collab with
###  🚕 Rapido, 🚌 Redbus, 🍿 Book my show, 🧰 Urban company, 🛒 Blinkit, 🍽️ Zomato

---

### 🤝 One-line Summary
Felina enables senior citizens (60+) to book Rapido rides, Movie tickets, Train tickets, Order food & Groceries through simple voice calls — 
unlocking a large, currently unreachable customer segment without requiring app usage or UI changes.

> **✨ Elders never interact with apps — Felina does on behalf of them.**

---

## 🎯 The Problem 

India has 140M+ elders, many of whom:
- Do not use smartphones confidently
- Struggle with apps, OTPs, and touch interfaces
- Depend on family or neighbors for short-distance travel

**Result today:**
- Elders avoid mobility unless assisted  
- Rapido loses a high-frequency, low-competition user group  
- Families shoulder unnecessary dependency burden  

> Digital adoption ≠ Digital accessibility.

---

## 💡 The Solution — Felina as a Voice Layer

Felina acts as a consent-first voice interface between elders and the app.

**How it works:**
1. Elder places a phone call to Felina  
2. Felina confirms intent + consent  
3. Felina books a Rapido ride, Movie ticket, train ticket, order food, order Groceries etc
4. Confirmation via voice + optional family notification  
5. SOS escalation if required  

> ✨ **Elder never touches an app. App gains a new rider.**

---

## 🤝 Why This Is Valuable

- 📈 **Incremental revenue** from a new elder segment  
- 💰 **Zero UI or driver app changes**  
- 🛡️ **Safety-first, consent-driven design**  
- 🌱 **Strong CSR & ESG alignment**  

---

## 🚀 Pilot Proposal (Low Risk)

- **Cities:** Chennai / Bengaluru  
- **Duration:** 60–90 days  
- **Target:** 5,000–10,000 elders  
- **Metrics:** ride completion, repeat usage, safety, family trust  

---

## ⭐ Closing Thought

**Felina does not compete with the app**  
Felina brings Mobile app to people who were never able to use it.
