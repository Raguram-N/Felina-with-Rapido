# 📄 Business Proposal
## Felina × Rapido
Voice-First Elder Mobility Partnership|

# 1️⃣ Executive Summary

India has over 140 million elderly citizens, many of whom face digital exclusion despite having real and recurring mobility needs.

Felina is a voice-first elder assistance AI that allows seniors (60+) to access services through simple phone calls, without smartphones, apps, or technical complexity.

This proposal outlines how integrating Felina with Rapido can:

Unlock 8–17 million new potential elder users

Increase ride frequency for short, daily trips

Position Rapido as India’s most inclusive mobility platform

Drive ethical growth without heavy customer acquisition costs

Felina does not compete with Rapido.
Felina becomes Rapido’s accessibility layer for elders.

2️⃣ Problem Statement (From Rapido’s Lens)
🚧 Current Gap in Mobility Platforms

Despite widespread adoption, elderly users remain under-represented on ride-hailing platforms due to:

App-dependent UX

OTP & login friction

Small text & touch interfaces

Fear of making mistakes

Dependence on family members

Digital adoption ≠ Digital accessibility

As a result:

Elders avoid ride apps

Families book on their behalf (low frequency)

A large mobility segment remains unmonetized

3️⃣ Solution: Felina × Rapido Integration
🧓 What Felina Does

Felina is a voice-first AI companion that enables elders to:

Call a phone number

Speak naturally in their preferred language

Request rides without apps or screens

Receive voice confirmations

Pay via cash or family-linked payment

🚕 What Rapido Gains

Felina acts as a voice booking gateway into Rapido’s existing system.

Elders never touch Rapido’s app.
Felina securely books Rapido rides on their behalf.

4️⃣ Elder Ride Experience Flow (Rapido)

Elder calls Felina

Felina greets in preferred language

Elder says: “I want to go to temple”

Felina confirms pickup & destination

Felina books a Rapido ride

Elder receives voice confirmation

Optional: Family gets SMS/WhatsApp update

No app. No OTP confusion. No stress.
